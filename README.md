Simple Python Keylogger 

Creating a keylogger involves interacting with low-level system events to record keystrokes. However, it is vital to remember that utilising keyloggers without users' explicit consent might raise ethical and legal concerns, as well as breach their privacy rights. As a result, keyloggers should only be used for genuine reasons, such as debugging or monitoring authorised actions with necessary permissions.

Before running this code, make sure you've installed the pynput library. This code creates a listener to catch keyboard events. When a key is pressed, the on_press callback function is invoked, adding the pressed key to the chosen log file. The listener runs until the 'Esc' key is tapped, after which the programme terminates.

Remember to look into ethical issues and secure necessary permits before using or installing a keylogger. Unauthorised usage of keyloggers can cause major legal and privacy concerns.
